Classify the Review

We all know that we have certain libraries to categorize reviews into sentiments but how about having categorized reviews and building a classification model by making use of those categories.

Goal: 
You are a Machine Learning Engineer in XYZ. Reviews of a set of films are given to you and your goal is to build a classification model and predict reviews as negative or positive which helps customers in one of the deciding factors to watch a film.

Data Description:
The given data is about reviews of different films from multiple genres and different languages.

Attribute information:
Id: Unique Identifier for each row.
Category: The reviews have been categorized into two categories representing positive review and negative review. 0 represents positive review and 1 represents a negative review.
text: review is basically text data and that has been Tokenized for all reviews in training and testing sets.

Provided Files:
Train File: This file consists of all features. It should be used for both training and validation purposes.
Test File: Test file consists of all attributes except the target variable and prediction is to be made for all the rows in the test file.
Sample Submission: This file is an example of how the solution file is to be created.

Objective of the Problem: 
The objective of the problem is to predict the categories of the "text" attribute in the "Text file" and write the same into a CSV(Comma Seperated Values) aong with the  "id" attribute. Please note that one to one mapping exists between all the attributes and the same must be preserved. Upload the predicted solution file using the upload file field below and click on  submit to get a score. View the sample submission file to get an understanding of how the solution file must be written. Please note that the headers of the solution file to get an understanding of how the solution  file must be written. Please note that the headers of the solution file being uploaded should be the same as the headers of the sample submission file.

Evaluation Criteria:
The evaluation metric for this problem statement is precision-based accuracy. All scores would be normalized to 100. If predictions are to be made for "y" tuples and "x" tuples are predicted with correctness, then the score assigned would be (x/y*100).
